Lab: Create a Voice Assistant with OpenAI's GPT-3 and IBM Watson

Building a virtual assistant that can:
- Take voice input,
- Convert it to text using speech-to-text technology,
- Send the text to OpenAI's GPT-3 model,
- Receive a response,
- Convert it to speech using text-to-speech technology and finally
- Play it back to the user.

The voice assistant will have a responsive front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and a reliable back-end using Flask.
